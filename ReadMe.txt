Using Xcode 8 and Swift 3.0, write a networked application which can fetch resources from at least 3 endpoints shown on JSON Placeholder [1]. The application MUST use this networking library [2] to fetch the resources. The results should be displayed in either a table view or collection, and cells should be selectable; however, the style and format of displaying results is up to the applicant.
